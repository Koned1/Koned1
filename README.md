## Welcome

ðŸš€ **Koned** â€” A passionate advocate for decentralization with an unyielding commitment to distributed systems and high-reliability networks. My journey in the world of validators began with a deep dive into blockchain technology, driven by a desire to make the world safer, more transparent, and resilient. Every node I deploy is not just another point in the network but a contribution to the future of the internet where trust is anchored by mathematics and security by hardware.

**Core Competencies:**
- Reliable setup and maintenance of nodes in high-load networks.
- Continuous monitoring and performance optimization.
- Professional work with major blockchain protocols and decentralized networks.
- Expertise in cryptography, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts.

**Portfolio Projects:**
